    <p1>The transformations of the universe have always seemed an abstract event, sometimes still without explanation; we can almost associate them with magic tricks on a completely dark stage, which cause temporal hiatuses where metamorphic processes move galactic, stellar and planetary layers. Such mergers provoked, millions of years ago, an explosion of life, where the first multicellular organisms of nature began to multiply but that, through, again, spatial mutations, were driven to their extinction. 
    <br><br>
   Repeating this vicious cycle of constant transformations, emerges a species that, millions of years later, would come to dominate the planet we inhabit, becoming a tireless force upon the earth and off cataloguing the natural world and its society as it unfolds. Assuming itself as a pole of constant creation, in the sense that every individual descends from a single cell, the human being is now face to face with the possibility of the emergence of a new cellular entity, which could be an indication for a confrontation between the human and a being beyond humanity—a metahuman. These transformative possibilities announce a challenge to the overcoming of Man over Nature, the power of humanity to redesign its own species. By questioning the present biological ideals, the premise inherent to the creation of this new entity projects mankind in a new evolutionary dimension.
    <br><br>
  In this chain of ideas, in an alternative reality, it is suggested, then, the possibility of the birth of a new entity that announces a new history of social, political and cultural conditions that go beyond the biological conditions inherent to the human being. Detaching itself from the canonical ideal of conception, and subverting the process of morphogenesis, this new being comes, then, to challenge the biological factors in question, which, in turn, will question the limits of biology, since there will be, notoriously, a reconfiguration of their own and collective identity, as well as the social structures in which these new entities emerge.
    <br><br>
 Far from the unity of the first cell, the organic identity of the human and its original ancestry, the subversion of the morphogenesis process proposes the creation of abstract sexes and new bodies. Moving away from the idea of perpetuating the sex and gender binarism, the possibility of this subversion exhibits potential for unfolding a continuous variation of body and sex, nature and matter.</p1>
        
    <h1>preface</h1> 
        <p1>It seems today we are stepping into a new era, where a genesis gives birth to blooming forms of our own corporeality, mentality and even sexuality. Under new conditions, human life found a new foothold. 
        <br><br>
        Something new has taken root in the world, there is a new beginning—a beginning of need, of will, of self. There is a creation in the works that will change humanity in every single shape. However, we question ourselves: what does it take to create this new entity, this new form of life?
        <br><br>
        The truth is that, somewhere in the seas and lads of Earth, biological processes started to change. Embryos began to gain new forms of development. The human being was never hierarchical and this entity will not be different; however, it will be powerful and grandiose, it will redefine humanity in a way we are set to embrace. 
        <br><br>
        We are witnessing a different kind of pregnancy. It is not new—it has happened many times before. Yet, it is evolution, it is happening in new ways of conception, birth, and growth. 
        </p1>
     
        <h1>I. conception</h1> 
   <p1>
    Denying centuries of triumph of the patriarchal model of desire and self-satisfaction, and converging into a new matrix of reproduction, new layers of conception emerge, far from a darwinian naturality of evolution, far from canonical manifestations of sexuality. Detached from regulatory structures of gender, harnessing desire as ceaseless intensity that produces new possibilities of creation, as a constant flowing that links together the most indifferent of bodies, particles, forces. Challenging the relations between body and sex, between nature and matter, every atom, every particle, every shape, every body driven by desire.
    <br><br>
    This desire entails the unification of forces and particles running at different speeds, entering different kinds of relations through different states of impulse. Away from being primarily repressed, desire ceaselessly spreads and produces modes of power that are neither primarily good nor bad, as they are not attached to any kind of preconception, elevating desire as the most primary intensity of sexuality. 
    <br><br>
    Once the human body finds itself detached from the regulatory norms of gender, from the prejudices associated with the sex-body relations, from canons of sexuality and building a notion of non-canonical conception, it becomes possible to create a new evolutionary extent, a dimension beyond humanity itself as challenger of the biological processes and constructions associated with desire, with body and sex relations, with nature and matter parallels. Desire, as a motor for the creation of polymorphia, of undefined bodies, through the conception between entities without defined sex or gender, causes the collision of particles and forces, not determining ethical positions but positions of will. Desire, disconnected from individual and non-subjectified impulses, manifests as an incessant intensity that produces new possibilities of transformation, instead of a cycle of accumulation and self-liberation.
    <br><br>
    The conception itself materializes by assuming the role of the female sex as key—female as a producer of life—, but once again detached from the notion of gender. The essence of a body is not defined by its properties, but by its power, by whether or not it connects with other bodies and even if they unite with one another in order to build a more powerful one. This is a body, not a way of synthesizing the morphologies of matter and the dynamics of discursive power, but as a mean of suberting those processes, of reprocessing nature and culture, biology and society, sex and gender splits. Unbound by gender or form, the mind has always had the capacity to break out, as now all the bodies are free.

        <h1>II. genesis</h1>
    <p1>Subverting morphogenesis and its stability as a biological process, face to face with the creation of mutable genes that cause de dilution of form. The subversion of the condition of morphogenesis highlights one of the most relevant phases of the development of the new being, its conception, its birth, its growth. Morphogenesis as a biological process, a generation of form, is attributed only once in the formation of a human being. It is an immutable and fixed condition, linked to growth mechanisms, causing a cell, tissue or organism to develop its own shape. The subversion of this process, the creation of shapeless, transforming, post-anatomical bodies, is established. An articulation with the formation of metasexuality.
    <br><br>
    We are now face to face with the birth of a being defined as metahuman, as metasexual, as post-anatomical, by proliferating the range of sexuality beyond binarism. This process of metamorphosis implies a change in biological sexuality, not creating a being subjugated to a single sex, allowing the flowing in a spectrum, unbounded by the stability of biological form. Metahuman and post-anatomical, proliferating the boundaries of biology, beyond binarism, beyond evolution itself.
    <br><br>
    The metasexual body is a state producing a disorientation of desire, of natural, cyclical, mechanical, transformative desire, a challenge to the categories of sex and gender as well as sexual orientation. The new body is no longer cateforizable in terms of morphological sex or gender, in terms of morphology or ultrastructure, it is an infinite of possibilities, an everlasting of potential contours. It is metahuman, beyond the understanding of gender as performative. 
    <br><br>
    The post-anatomical body is an event to set in motion a proliferation of sexes, as sexuality is understood as moments of production of sexes that do not relate to the gender binary. Traditional perspectives of sexuality are based on a controled devellopment of the body in terms of functional reproduction, reducing biological sex to the anatomical production of the genitals. But desire flows through a multiplicity of intensities in motion, denying the stability of traditional sexuality and defyind the unity of the biological processes. How is our look drawn by diffuse forces of desire that traverse bodies in their ways of looking, ways of moving, ways of standing, ways of talking, that is, of different kinds of anatomy? We are propelled into the future, morphing into something beyond, through an eerily beautiful birth of a new world.

    <h1>III. growth</h1>
    <p1>All ideals will be reformulated. Under new conditions, every particle, every shape, every body will transform. Speculating on the possibilities associated with a new evolutionary dimension, its development and its micro behaviours, a growing body reconfigures patterns that determine its adaptation and survival. Through the deconstruction of the regulatory norms of sex and gender, political, cultural and social structures are transformed, reversed, traversed and deviated, an everlasting embodiment of growth and transformation.
    <br><br>
    Each action, each change, each transformative development inherent to the being’s formation, even if involuntary, modifies the environment in which it is framed, it transforms, it alters, it converts. What would be the impact on a set of social structures reconfigured by the implications of its existence?
    <br><br>
    Cultural paradigms define the multiple paths, standards, knowledge, beliefs, laws that organise humanity into its present relationships, as well as into its future perspectives—a transition from biological order to cultural dogmas. However, the disconnection from cultural patterns is inevitable. We invoke evolution to return to the biological core, we harness nature to destroy the concessions of gender, we allow the creation of sexual and asexual beings.
     <br><br>
    Post-intimacy is stimulated, daring individualism, contesting the disconnection between individuals, defending a plurality of bodies and their respective interactions with post-anatomy as a motor. This is a new state of evolution. Humanity will be decentralised from the structures it once dominated, from knowledge and science, from culture and faith, denying mankind as the centre of the universe and as last state of evolution, relegating organised beliefs that perpetuate structures of power, dominance and the creation of conflict, challenging the anthropomorphic dogmas, as well as the creationist emergence of humanity.

     <h1>Epilogue</h1>
    <p1>We are heading towards a new self-being, a totally different sequence of living things following its own pattern of evolution. Although, it seems like an abstraction, like if we are watching a magician’s trick on a darkened stage where particles and cells are moving so slowly but, at the same time, so fast. Everything in this new dimension is dark and deep, but there is also something beautiful, contemplative and unique about it. 
    <br><br>
    From now on, this is our new reality. Every single thing on this newborn has to be seen as an improvement in order to have, hopefully, better living conditions and a society where gender and identity do not follow the strict patterns that are imposed in these days. We are heading towards a new tireless force upon the Earth, and we are going to be a part of it.
