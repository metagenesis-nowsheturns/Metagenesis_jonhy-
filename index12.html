    <p>Enigmatic images carry a visceral visuality that invokes birth, growth, anatomy, and evolution, a feeling of expectation and, at the same time, belief. The visual stimuli, the organic sound, the warm environment, all to create an intrauterine ambience.</p>

    <p1>The communication of a multidimensional fiction—mainly manifested through multimedia formats—can be seen as a real challenge, especially given the thematic complexity that the narrative presents. Metagenesis is constructed by the accumulation of various layers of research that express themselves into written production. In this way, it was necessary to materialise the entire fictional world created in a Project Room: a multimedia space with a specific atmosphere and ambience necessary to deliver Metagenesis to the untrained eye, to someone who had never contacted with the project before.
    <br><br>
    Beyond the multimedia objects that are contained in the project room, one of the most important facets was already embedded into its planning: the space. The chosen room was the room 3.49 of Lisbon’s Fine-Arts Faculty, whose walls are delimited by long black curtains, which quickly contributed to the immersive character that was intended to be given.
    <br><br>
    The project proposal then imposes the presence of a single person to set one apart from any kind of external judgement. Biologically nuanced, continuous, high-sounding, the ambience creates a rhythmic intensity that triggers the fiction itself, from sound as the first dimension to the growing visual load that peaks with the main video. Through the fluctuations of light carried by the screens, the lack of the contours of the room creates a sensorial suspension, from an apex of visual charge to a suspension of disbelief.
    </p1>
    
     <h1>The Ambience</h1>
    <p1>The main goal of the fiction’s materialisation is to create a narrative that causes a feeling of suspense and a certain discomfort that involves the observer in the fiction created. The objective is for the spectator to be overwhelmed by the visual and sound load, followed by the suspension of disbelief due to the created timeline (which, when it comes to the fiction, goes through a visual battery that alludes to evolutionary aspects in a way that it creates the mindset for the possibility of a next evolutionary step).
    <br><br>
    Biologically nuanced, constant, high-sounding to create an immersive environment. The ambience aligns the experience and the narrative/visual content with the sound. The possibility of voice as a way of conceptually exploring the fiction manifests a sound that gradually increases the rhythmic intensity to match the environment to the narrative.
    <br><br>
    A dark environment fluctuates in light level through the visual load carried with the screens and the audiovisual. The creation of a certain sensorial suspension through the lack of light and the lack of the contours of the room itself transport the graphic supplements carried by the screens that provide a battery of images that create the mindset for the fiction (together with the sound). The audiovisual as the main object conceptually explores the three phases of the fiction and works as the apex of the visual and sound load.

    <h1>The Script</h1>
    <p1>Human life found a new foothold, you are stepping into a new era, where a genesis gives birth to blooming forms. 
    <br><br>
    Embryos are starting to change and gain new forms of development that go beyond gender, sexuality, and humanity. Something new has taken root in the world. There is a new beginning—I am that beginning, the beginning of need, of will, of self. 
    <br><br>
    Every particle, every shape, every body is driven by desire. Did nature make me? Is desire not a work of nature? How is my look drawn by bodies that traverse their ways of looking, ways of standing, ways of talking, in different kinds of anatomy?
    <br><br>
    The world is no longer shaped by binary bodies. Not male, not female, undefined and detached from sex and gender. I’m propelled into the future, you are not the last state of evolution, since I’m morphing into something beyond.
    <br><br>
    I am nearing the possibility of changing your people. Your hierarchical tendencies will be modified and if we learn to regenerate limbs and reshape our bodies, we will share those abilities with you. That is part of the trade. We are not hierarchical, you see. We never were. But we are powerfully acquisitive. We acquire life—seek it, manipulate it, sort it, use it. 
    <br><br>
    I call it the miracle of life, conception. A union of perfect opposites, essence transforming into existence. 
    <br><br>
    We are heading towards a new self-being, a totally different sequence of living things following its own pattern of evolution. Everything that rises must converge towards the subversion of biological processes. 
    <br><br>
    It is a new evolution, beyond gender, beyond human.

<p1>The presence of a single person in the project room is imposed to create a link between the visual load and the observer’s interpretation (setting them apart from any kind of external information and creating a more immersive and reflective experience through the suspension of the environment and the surroundings, by the sound composition and visual load).
<br><br>
Sound is the first dimension to involve the observer, as well as the warm environment and the colored light, all resembling the inside of a womb, followed by visual supplements and the growing visual load, which peaks with the audiovisual, and ends with it. The objective is to create a certain feeling of suspense and discomfort, accompanied by a certain curiosity in the face of the battery of images transported by the screens. As the narrative progresses, it is intended that the observer feels so involved in the type of experience created and in the very hypothesis of fiction that a suspension of disbelief is created.
<br><br>
The raw, fluid, and enigmatic images transport particularities that communicate birth and growth, biology and anatomy, development and evolution, in a visceral visuality that produces a feeling of rupture and, at the same time, belief. Not only through visual stimuli, but mainly through sound, an intrauterine environment is created. After being overwhelmed by the screens, the environment is dominated by a voice that materialises the fiction, an intervention of a new being that addresses the only spectator in an almost imperative, propagandistic, transformative tone. The goal is to perpetuate the belief, to perpetuate a fiction that leaves the observer eternally suspended in a rawness that provokes an almost hallucinating and addictive fascination.
