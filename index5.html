    <p>Biology can reconfigure society and human behavior through the subversion of biological processes that are capable of decentering the human being from the social structures previously built to its measure. In that way, each of us developed individual perspectives on different dimensions of the fiction. Our approach was not to take detours from the main narrative, but instead to add layers of significance and expand subjects we found worthy of expansion: science and knowledge, religion, relationships, and culture.</p>

    <p2> An introduction on the new self-being<br>by duarte costa</p2>
    <p1>Human evolution and the various transformations associated with it have been part of the constant mergers through which the universe has passed. As a result of these changes, where countless multicellular organisms began to multiply, a species emerged—the human being,—that, millions of years later, would come to dominate the Earth, assuming itself as a tireless force that catalogs society through its dominant character. 
    <br><br>
    Associated with the prevalence of Man, intellectual movements emerged, such as the Enlightenment or Humanism, which served science and knowledge and placed him as the center of the Universe—all data, studies, and standards present in today’s society are based on the study of Man.
    <br><br>
    In <i>An Introduction on The New Self-Being</i>, the birth of a new entity is suggested, the result of the conception between sexed and asexual bodies, which will question the dominance of Man, thus forcing his decentralization from the center of the universe. Knowledge and science will then be reconfigured through the delinking of the metahuman being from gender and fixed biological sex. All the ideals of society, which are based on knowledge and science around Man, will be reformulated, as will the social structures in which these new entities arise.</p1>

    <p2> From human genesis to its future<br>by rodrigo amancio</p2>
    <p1>Evolution does not end with mankind and life evolved before humans even existed. Energy generated matter, matter generated life, life generated intelligence—intelligence generated God. But matter is not substance. In the Cartesian tradition, substance corresponds to the non-extended God separated from the physical world of nature. The split between the mind and the body originated from the separation of the cosmos from matter, of the transcendent God—the power of the soul-mind—from nature—the power of the physical body. The body originates in God as God corresponds to an intensive and extensive substance. Matter is able to manifest itself through the ceaseless mutation of bodies and things in nature. 
    <br><br>
    <i>From Human Genesis to its Future</i> denies organized religions that perpetuate structures of power and dominance, as it denies the creation of conflict. It contests the creationist emergence of humanity, the conception of an anthropomorphic God. From Human Genesis to its Future explores the prospect of a universal belief that links together biological processes and their evolutionary purpose.If such a doctrine were to be spread, what would become of the unchangeable dogmas, what of the unity and the stability of the Creed? From Human Genesis to its Future seeks a transcendent harmony, instead of a petty power; an intelligent presence, instead of a benevolent entity; a universal force, instead of an anthropomorphic deity.

    <p2>Becoming<br>by maria bastos</p2>
    <p1>Since the beginning, the evolution of the species, along with biology and culture, has mobilized individuals towards a new perception as a being, leading to the collective awareness that the Self arises from the We. In <i>Becoming</i>, after centuries of triumph of the patriarchal model of desire and self-satisfaction, society converges on a new matrix of reproduction and evolution, in a post-anatomical and post-gender condition. In this custom-made world of the metahuman, social and reproductive processes are beyond biological standards. Sex is a mode—an intensive modification or extension of matter—which is analogous neither to sexual reproduction nor to the sexual organs. It’s mechanical and natural. As a result of this change, relationships are no longer unilateral, they multiply among the most different bodies, particles and forces, in a new evolutionary moment; into a new humanity.

    <p2>The possibilities under the laws of nature<br>by francisco janes</p2>
    <p1>Culture, as we know it, defines the various paths, standards, knowledge, beliefs, laws that lead human groups to their present relationships and their future perspectives. All human beings are faced with an identical fact in all societies: sexual difference. In each culture its own symbolization of the difference between the sexes takes place and generates multiple versions of the male/female dichotomy. This binarism is the result of a unique process: that of its humanization, that is, its progressive departure from the biological order and its transition to culture.
    <br><br>
    In a world limited by the ideological and social structures constructed by the human being, the fictional proposal seeks, through an alternative post-gender and post-anatomical reality, to deconstruct the concept of masculine and feminine and disconnect them from cultural patterns, until now in force in society. Making use of Metagenesis, a return to biology and nature is sought in order to destroy the cultural and social concessions of gender, thus, this becomes a natural possibility, which allows the emergence of new sexual and asexual beings.
