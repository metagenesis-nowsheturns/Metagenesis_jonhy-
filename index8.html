    <p>The very representation of a body may involve its own deconstruction, humanising, rather than sexualizing, fluid, polymorphic, non-canonical. Analysing <i>Titane</i>, by Julia Ducournau, we find ourselves face to face to a disruptive way of celebrating the alliance of fiction and the concept of identity, a subversion of gender itself. Far stronger, far wilder, far stranger, the radical fiction of the premise wrenches the ensuing reality into a speculative deconstruction that demands a suspension of disbelief. </p>
  
    <h1>The Essay</h1>
    <p2> <i>Titane — Beyond gender, beyond human</i><br>by rodrigo amancio</p2>
    <p1>I remember there was something going through me, a feeling that I was propelled into the future somehow... that felt way beyond me. Describing the extreme feeling of transformation, from transforming to being transformed, invokes the essence of a dramatic change in form. The transformative qualities of a mutating body expand the possibilities of its own representation, its own deconstruction, daring the limits of physical modification and the graphic plasticity of the represented body. Naked, fluid, polymorphic, subsumed by a non-canonical expression in a way that embeds the body with an extreme symbolic power. 
    <br><br>
    Keeping off-putting crudity, with which it provokes our repulsion through bodily mutilation, <i>Titane</i> involves a thought-provoking construction of a humanism that contrasts with any expectation. Despite the raging physical representations, an overwhelming metaphorical power creates a celebration of the body, of the bond between pain and pleasure, agony and ecstasy—and that proves to hold for identity as well.
    <br><br>
    From the bind between sexuality and fluidity, display pleasure with its ever more vehement motion and flashing lights. Naked, real, humanized, express non-conforming realities allied to transformative fictions. Once again, manifest a transforming yet transformed body that reflects a deeper extent. The representation of a female body entrenches an ingeniously constructed dimension. Raw, inflamed, non-sexualized, functioning as an anti-male gaze, serving as representation of emotion, performing as reflection of trauma.
    <br><br>
    As a common erotic approach, there is nothing surprising with this juxtaposition, but we take it as symbolic of what is yet to come—a communion between man—or Woman—and machine. The bodies in motion end up creating an extreme aesthetic fascination. A rhythm out of control. A stimulating merge of human and machine, flesh and metal, through a provocative fusion between fiction and the concept of self.
    <br><br>
    Each body, each representation, creates a sense of psyche, expressive, individual, disruptive, autonomous, yet connected to culture’s continuum. Perform in multiple realities, inflate polymorphic possibilities, automorph mind and body, devise, traverse. Accentuate the amplitude of self-transformation to accomplish self-creation as a matter of selective individual choice—whether abstract or concrete, whether artefact or non-form.
    <br><br>
    The noncompliant way of exalting the concept of identity forces the subversion of gender itself. Through a speculative deconstruction of any expectation, a seductive contemplation of gender harnesses experiences of fluidity, non-binarism, contrasting representations of gender as performative, volatile, evaporative, rather than biological and established. <i>Metagender</i> as a productive state of disorientation of desire challenges categories of sex-gender identity, not ultimately categorizable in terms of morphology. It is <i>postqueer</i>, beyond the understanding of gender as a performance.
    <br><br>
    The androgynous body deformed by the binds tosses off an extraordinary detail, it ponders and absorbs its mystery, it goes deeper to shed the layers of representation to get beauty out of it. Baring not muscle but metal, dark-oil covered skin mutating into a warm redemption story of fluidity. If a body is not a being, but a variable, a surface where permeability is evanescent, a symbolic form regulated by a spectrum, then what language is left for understanding this corporeal performance? If gender attributes are not expressive, but performative, these traits soundly create the identity they are said to express. "If gender attributes and acts, the various ways in which a body shows or produces its cultural signification, are distorted acts of gender, and the postulation of a true gender identity would be revealed as a regulatory fiction." [Judith Butler].
    <br><br>
    A singular body, unique and plural, polymorphic and shapeless, crude and expressive, subverting its own linearity and propelling into its own logic—like a world unto itself. In the core of the representation that ingrains an addictive compulsion, the cathartic contemplation on identity, selfhood and transformation becomes compelling. Through a bodily fluid-dripping surface, ever-changing, set in motion by the elation of fiction—beyond gender, beyond human.
