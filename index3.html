    <p>Identity, as a notion, regulates human beings according to stabilizing concepts of sex, gender, and sexuality. However, the existing perception of this set of concepts is challenged by those who deviate from the standards of conformity, or whose gender is incoherent or discontinuous.</p>

    <h1>Synopsis</h1>
    <p1><i>METAGENESIS—BEYOND GENDER, BEYOND HUMAN </i>seeks to create a narrative that speculates on the possibility of a new entity that goes beyond the biological conditions inherent to the human being by subverting the morphogenesis process—the genetic predisposition inherent to the human being that defines the (fixed) way in which it develops, a biological factor that regulates the production of the shape. The possibility of bodies with no form or anatomy departs from the film <i>Titane</i> (2021), by Julia Ducournau, where the birth of a new being, inherently linked to a non-biological conception, already indicates the confrontation between the standards of social conformity.
   <br><br> 
    A new evolutionary dimension, its development, and its micro-behaviours reconfigure patterns that determine its adaptation and survival. Each action and reconfiguration associated with this being, even if involuntary, modifies the environment in which it is framed. Far from the unity of the first cell, far from the organic identity of humanity, the subversion of morphogenesis proposes the creation of new bodies and abstract sexes. Moving away from the perpetuation of the sex and gender binarism, this possibility unfolds a continuous variation of body and sex, nature and matter, evolution and mankind.</p1>
