<p1>The <i>First Installment, A New Foothold—The Set of a New Entity </i>, deals with the setting of a fiction based on Julia
Ducournau’s Titane. We have departed from the idea of identity as a notion that regulates the categorizations
attributed to human beings according to stabilizing and fixed concepts of sex, gender and sexuality. The existing
perception of this set of concepts is challenged by those who deviate from the standards of conformity, whose
gender is incoherent or discontinuous. The concept of identity is questioned as well as what conventionally
consolidates the assumption that it is uniform, constant over time, and standardised.
<br><br>
The <i>Second Installment, Emerging—Beyond Gender, Sexuality, and Humanity</i>, explores the concepts
introduced previously, applying them in the proposed fiction—a society where the concept of identity is
questioned through the emergence of a new being, whose conception develops through the subversion of
biological processes. This instalment also sheds some light on what led us to wove this intricate fabric
Metagenesis sits on. There is an exposition of the three phases of this being, which will cover the moment of
biological creation—Conception—birth—Genesis—and, finally, development—Growth.
<br><br>
The <i>Third Installment, Transposing—Essence Transforming Into Existence</i>, widens the process responsible for
the materialisation of the Project Room, an immersive space that provoked a multisensory experience that gave
form to the fiction itself, that gave voice and purpose to a newborn that deviates gender norms, and dilates the
next evolutionary step. The ambience had multiple layers that shaped the narrative, the light fluctuations, the
sound, the visceral and enigmatic images—all devising an intrauterine environment to leave the spectator in an
ever-lasting suspense.
<br><br>
The <i>Fourth Installment, The Miracle of Life—A New Evolution</i>, casts the nuances of an epilogue that does not
propose to conclude the fiction, but instead justifies and perpetuates the suspense desired by both the narrative
and its materialisation. On a personal note, we not only disclaim how we perceived the whole process and its
pertinence by challenging a set of human constructs, but we also speculate about the fiction’s suspension of
disbelief as well as its next step. Just as any biological evolutionary process, we state how our fiction
descended from an original single cell and branched out almost infinitely.
